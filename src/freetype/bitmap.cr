    # The pitch's absolute value is the number of bytes taken by one bitmap row, including padding.
    # However, the pitch is positive when the bitmap has a ‘down’ flow, and negative when it has
    # an ‘up’ flow. In all cases, the pitch is an offset to add to a bitmap pointer in order
    # to go down one row.
    #
    # Note that ‘padding’ means the alignment of a bitmap to a byte border, and FreeType functions
    # normally align to the smallest possible integer value.
    #
    # For the B/W rasterizer, pitch is always an even number.
    #
    # To change the pitch of a bitmap (say, to make it a multiple of 4), use FT_Bitmap_Convert.
    # Alternatively, you might use callback functions to directly render to the application's
    # surface; see the file example2.cpp in the tutorial for a demonstration.
